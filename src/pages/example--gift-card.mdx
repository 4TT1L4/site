## What is a gift card?

In the context of this tutorial a gift card will involve locking some assets
in a smart contract. While some assets are being locked, we'll mint an NFT in
the same transaction. This NFT could be sent anywhere and the owner of the NFT
can burn it to unlock the assets there were previously locked. We can consider
the NFT as a gift card.

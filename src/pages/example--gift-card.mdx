# Gift Card

Let's build a UI to send and redeem a gift card using smart contracts on Cardano.

## Covered in this tutorial

- writing `Aiken`
- parameterizing scripts
- using [lucid](https://lucid.spacebudz.io/)
- using [deno fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/)

<Callout type="info">
  â˜… You should install deno using these
  [instructions](https://deno.land/manual@v1.29.1/getting_started/installation).
</Callout>

## What is a gift card?

In the context of this tutorial a gift card will involve locking some assets
in a smart contract. While some assets are being locked, we'll mint an NFT in
the same transaction. This NFT could be sent anywhere and the owner of the NFT
can burn it to unlock the assets there were previously locked. We can consider
the NFT as a gift card.

## Aiken is the easy part

Let's go ahead and create a new `Aiken` project:

```sh
aiken new my-org/gift-card
cd gift-card
```

<Callout type="info">
  `my-org` above can be replaced by any name. We recommend using the name of a
  Github organization or your own username.
</Callout>

We've already covered what `aiken new` generates in a previous tutorial so
let's jump right into some code.

Go ahead and remove the `lib/` folder, we won't be needing that for this tutorial.

```
rm -rf lib
```

Now let's create a new file in the `validators/` folder called `main.ak`.

```
touch validators/main.ak
```

<Callout type="info">
  `main.ak` could be named anything. Any file in `validators/` is allowed to
  export as many validators as you'd like.
</Callout>

Now let's open the project folder in our favorite editor and define two empty
validator functions.

```aiken filename="validators/main.ak"
use aiken/transaction.{ScriptContext}

validator {
  fn gift_card(rdmr, ctx: ScriptContext) -> Bool {
    todo @"mint and burn"
  }
}

validator {
  fn redeem(d, r, ctx: ScriptContext) -> Bool {
    todo @"redeem"
  }
}
```

The `gift_card` validator will be used to mint and burn the NFT.

# Getting Started

## Installation

### From aikup

First, install `aikup`: a basic utility tool to download and manage Aiken's
pre-compiled executables:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://install.aiken-lang.org | bash
```

Then, simply run:

```
aikup
```

<Callout type="info">
  `aikup` alone installs the latest version available. You can install specific versions
  by specifying a version number. For usage instructions, use `aikup --help`.
</Callout>

### From source

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken.git
```

<Callout type="info">
  `cargo` is a package manager for Rust. To install it, please refer to [the
  Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
</Callout>

### From Nix flakes

```sh
nix build github:aiken-lang/aiken#aiken
```

## Quickstart

```sh
aiken --help
```

### Aiken's prelude

The `prelude` contains a minimum set of functions, constructors and modules
available _by default_ to all Aiken projects. You can find it on
[aiken-lang/prelude](https://aiken-lang.github.io/prelude/) and at the bottom
of this website.

### Aiken's standard library

The standard library (or `stdlib` in short) gathers useful functions and
data-structures that might come in handy in your Aiken programming journey.
It's also a good reference of well-written and well-tested Aiken code if you
need some examples to get started with. You can find it on
[aiken-lang/stdlib](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/) and at the bottom of
this website.

## Editor integrations

The following plugins provide syntax highlighting and indentation rules for Aiken.
